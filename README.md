HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies used in web development to create and style web pages.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Role: HTML is the standard markup language used to structure content on the web. It provides a set of elements or tags that define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
Syntax: HTML uses a tag-based syntax, where elements are enclosed in opening and closing tags. Tags provide information about the content they enclose and how it should be displayed.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Role: CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page, ensuring a consistent and appealing design.
Syntax: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and applies rules to define how those elements should be styled. Rules consist of property-value pairs that specify aspects like color, size, margin, padding, and more.
Bootstrap:

Description: Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that simplifies and accelerates web development. It provides a set of pre-designed and responsive components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and grids, which can be easily integrated into web projects.
Features:
Responsive Design: Bootstrap ensures that web applications look and function well on various devices and screen sizes.
Component Library: It offers a wide range of pre-built components, reducing the need for custom styling and enhancing development efficiency.
Grid System: Bootstrap's grid system facilitates the creation of responsive layouts by dividing the page into a grid of rows and columns.
Customization: Developers can customize Bootstrap by using its preprocessor variables or by utilizing custom themes to match specific design requirements.
In summary, HTML defines the structure of a web page, CSS styles the elements to make them visually appealing, and Bootstrap is a framework that provides pre-designed components and tools to streamline the development process and create responsive and visually consistent web applications.
